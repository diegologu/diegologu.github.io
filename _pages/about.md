I'm Diego Lopez Guerrero, a Ph.D. student in the [SPARK Laboratory](https://sparklab.engr.uky.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Dan M. Ionel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jkL_-FIAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Kentucky. I started my doctoral journey after earning my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Universidad de La Sabana in Colombia in 2024.

Before beginning the Ph.D. program, I had the opportunity to work as a Visiting Student Scholar at the SPARK Lab, where I contributed to the mechanical design of two prototype systems exploring advanced concepts in electric machines. During my undergrad years, I was part of the first and only colombian [team](https://www.instagram.com/uhev.col/) in the [Shell Eco-Marathon](https://www.shellecomarathon.com/) competition. For which we designed, built, and raced ultra-efficient electric vehicles, participating in the Brazil 2022 competition.

I was fortunate to be awarded the Excellence Scholarship throughout my time at La Sabana, and now I serve as both a Teaching Assistant in the ECE Department and a Research Assistant at the SPARK Lab. My current research focuses on electric machines, with a special interest in electric propulsion systems for aircraft.
